# RBN_soil_detector_project1-2-KTN
## Building a soil detector

This project is a DIY soil moisture detector that helps measure the water content in the soil. It is designed for simple, low-cost environmental monitoring and can be used in gardens, farms, or academic projects. The soil detector makes use of sensors, Arduino code, and 3D-printed parts to provide a complete hardware and software solution.

## Features
-Detects soil moisture levels accurately.
-Arduino-based for easy coding and hardware integration.
-Includes 3D printable parts (STL & STEP files) for housing and assembly.
-Bill of materials included for easy sourcing of components.
-Schematics and diagrams for simple wiring and assembly.

## How to Build
1- Download the files in the repository.
2- Print the 3D parts using the provided STL or STEP files.
3- Gather all required components from the Bill of Materials.
4- Assemble the circuit using the provided schematics.
5- Upload the Arduino code (soil detector code.ino) to your micro-controller.
6- Test the soil detector by inserting the sensor into the soil and monitoring the readings.
